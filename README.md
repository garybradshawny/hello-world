# hello-world
I worked at Finserv Computer Corp. in Schenectady NY for a decade or so.  Clients included Worthington Service Corp., several Direct Mail retailers, and the New York State Senate among many others.
Finserv closed while I was working with Davis Vision, a client, and I went to work for them as their Software Architect. I retired from Davis Vision after 30 years, having designed and coded their mainframe transaction processing system CompuVision and watched all of the related systems it spawned over the years.
